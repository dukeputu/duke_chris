                     <h1> Group Coaching</h1>
                     <p>These sessions are ideal for players of any level looking to improve their game alongside others. You’ll find a great balance of developing core skills and putting these skills into real-world matches. Perfect for those with a strong desire to better their badminton, group sessions are scheduled regularly to work around you. Weekly, fortnightly or monthly yield the best results.  
                     </p>
                     <p>Typically built for between 6 to 10 players, the smaller groups allow me to dedicate time equally to all players, ensuring no one is left behind. Together we’ll look at where you are and talk about where you want to be and plan how to achieve that. 
                     </p>
                      <p>I can teach and modify the skills neededto improve anyone at badminton. From footwork to tactics, I’ll cover a variety of styles of play to make sure you can adapt your game style to achieve success. It’s important to have a plan b, or even plan c available during games as no player or opponent is the same. I can help finesse technical areas or work on partnership dynamics in doubles matches.
