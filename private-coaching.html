                  <h1> Private Coaching</h1>
                  <p>Your game will improve dramatically with 1:1 training. Through personalised coaching, I will assess
                     your skill level, define goals and tailor programmes that work for you. If players are at a similar
                     skill level, these sessions could work for a maximum of 3, but it’s important not to detract from
                     each individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>Available for any skill level, your sessions will be bespoke and designed to fit you and allow you
                     to achieve your full potential. I know there isn’t a “one size fits all” approach to badminton
                     coaching, that’s why in these private coaching sessions we’ll look at your strengths, areas of
                     improvement and the goals you want to reach. This will also help you develop the badminton style
                     you want to play.
                  </p>
                  <p>Players thrive when sessions are completely tailored to their style, personality and wellbeing. I
                     want you to be able to take control on court and enhance your existing skills to really get you to
                     the next level. You might need to focus on court coverage with your footwork. Or you might need to
                     work on reading the game, like anticipating where you need to move next, where your opponent is and
                     reading where they will play their next shot.
                  </p>
                  <p>I can work on whatever broad or nuanced area you need.We’ll track progress so you know what your
                     development looks like, too. Your objectives are my objectives. </p>
