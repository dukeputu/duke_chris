                  <h1> Masterclass </h1>
                  <p>This is the ultimate badminton experience; a 360, rounded session that covers
                     every aspect of badminton, and more. Designed to bring players together,
                     masterclass tours will be available throughout the UK across a number of
                     days. These sessions are designed for between 8-16 players, and are open to
                     anyone who wants to develop their badminton skills. Where possible sessions
                     will be arranged into players of a similar skill level. This will give
                     everyone a better experience, with the opportunity to learn and grow
                     together.
                  </p>
                  <p>With a minimum length of two hours, there’s plenty of time to cover what you
                     need to know. There’ll be everything from drills to tactical aspects like
                     footwork efficiency; looking at agile ways to cover more of the court while
                     moving less. The masterclass leaves time for fine tuning existing skills to
                     maximise gains in matches, too. Plus, an opportunity to put learnings into
                     practice, and even give me a run for my money on the court!
                  </p>
                  <p>You’ll experience a number of professional training routines, including how
                     to prepare yourself for a match, mentally and physically. There’ll be fun,
                     informal sections blended with competitive challenges and team tasks. I’ll
                     cover a range of practices and conditioned games to test and develop your
                     tactical prowess, making sure you feel hard work is rewarded, but enjoying
                     yourself, too. These masterclasses provide the
                     perfect environment to really
                     push yourself. And you’ll be surrounded by like-minded, ambitious
                     badminton players, too.
